# Assets Folder

This folder contains all static assets used in the scapeT landing page.

## Structure

```
assets/
├── images/          # Image files (team photos, etc.)
├── icons/           # Icon files
└── logos/           # Logo files (Cursor brand assets)
```

## Usage

- **Images**: Team photos and other image assets
- **Icons**: Custom icon files (if needed)
- **Logos**: Brand logos and wordmarks

## Cursor Brand Assets

The Cursor brand assets are located in the `cursor-brand-assets/` folder at the root level. These include:

- App Icons
- Avatars
- General Logos (Wordmark, Lockup Horizontal/Vertical, Cube)

The landing page uses the Cursor Wordmark logos from:
`cursor-brand-assets/General Logos/Wordmark/SVG/`

## Notes

- All paths in the HTML are relative to the root directory
- SVG files are preferred for logos (scalable and lightweight)
- PNG files are available as fallbacks
